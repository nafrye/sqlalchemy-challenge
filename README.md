This repository contains a resources folder as well as a file to analyze and explore climate data as well as a landing page to explore the data.

I used information from the class slack channel for the minimum functions (that worked). I could not figure out how to compute minimums from the landing page

I had two areas of trouble:
1. the bar chart - specifically not including every date on the x-axis as a label
2. computing means for certain date ranges from the landing page
